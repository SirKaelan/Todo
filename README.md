## Description

This was my first attempt at a bigger project. I tried using and getting a bit more experience with React Context for state management and I tried to implement a more sophisticated approach to using Context that enabled the developer to have an API to work with this technology. Another goal was to get a better feeling for how to combine Typescript with React. I also tried experimenting a bit more with a folder structure to see what would best fit me and would help me navigate everything a bit more easily. This project was also the first time I attempted to install SASS and set it up to work with React and its CSS module system. And finally I decided to dip my feet a bit into React component testing, but I didn't end up using that code much and scrapped it, however this experience helped me to understand how testing works a little bit better.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`
