# A glorified to-do list app (a lot of features in one place)
# I want to quickly add tasks before i forget them and have it be automatically organized
# I want to give the task an hour and duration and have it be added to my Google Calendar with set color
# Can Google Calendar give feedback on when it has passed an event on the calendar? (might have some uses)
# I want to easily reorganize the tasks on the list
# Do i want to be able to filter the list?

# Feature ideas from Google:
<MVP> - create tasks
  - create sub-tasks
  - add comments? to tasks
  - add note taking capabilities? (not sure how useful this is)
  - add reminders? and events in Calendar (presumably Google's)
  - set start-end date on tasks for deadlines (a.k.a due dates)
  - add time estimates on tasks (for teams - might not add; will maybe work together with "time tracking" feature)
  - time tracking for tasks?
  - add priority flags to tasks (task prioritization)
<MVP> - check/uncheck tasks
  - a view for overdue tasks
  - reorder tasks (drag and drop)
  - task archive view
  - autocomplete for tags
  - task sorting functionality
  - star tasks or somehow visually distinguish them from others (i.e. by color)
  - bulk edit for several tasks (to fix due dates or something)
  - be able to use the calendar in the app
  - optional reminders for tasks (unsure for this one, might not find it useful)
  
# My own ideas (again from other apps i've seen online):
  - add a description to tasks
  - Pomodoro stopwatch for the procrastinators?
    > Keep track of today's pomodoros, total amount, total minutes or hours of focus or just for the day, etc.
  - add tags to tasks or whatever else
  - make lists (a new named page for you to add tasks)
  - filtering capabilities (based on... something not sure as of yet)
  - search bar/window (to search through tags, lists, tasks, etc.)
  - habit tracking section
  - make tasks recurring in a custom manner (every day, every wednesday, etc.)
    > Set those properties upon adding a task
  - have the ability to add the task for today, tomorrow or some other day
  - be able to add emojis to everything (makes for faster work by looking at an emoji than reading what a certain thing is, if that makes sense)
<MVP> - be able to edit and delete tasks
  - be able to create projects that contain lists that contain tasks
  - maybe have a way to track how many tasks you've done for the day and be able to customize that (as a fun challenge for yourself or something)
